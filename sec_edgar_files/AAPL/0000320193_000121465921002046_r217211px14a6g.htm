<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In 2002 I petitioned the SEC to allow proxy access proposals.
It took 8 years for the SEC to agree. In 2014, I presented a proxy access proposal at Apple. The Board adopted a flawed proxy
access a year later. Unfortunately, it only allows shareholders to nominate one candidate, not &ldquo;20% or 2, whichever is greater.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s the industry standard.&nbsp;It takes two directors to ensure a discussion at a Board meeting, one to move an item,
the other to second it. That&rsquo;s why the standard is 2.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: #222222">Apple says its provisions are &ldquo;well within
the mainstream.&rdquo; Yet, Arch Coal is the only company I could find that allows only one nominee. Are they mainstream? No!</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: #222222">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: #222222">Apple says &ldquo;special interests&rdquo;
could disrupt the board if they allow for two candidates. Why is Apple so much more vulnerable to disruption than Adobe, AES,
AutoZone, or hundreds of others? &nbsp;86% of companies with proxy access allow shareholders to nominate at least 2 directors.
14% have a standard like Apple.&nbsp;<I>BUT</I>, those companies, such as Amazon, have boards of 10 or more, so 20% still yields
at least 2 candidates.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: #222222">We have directors, our representatives, who
have served for more than 18 years. Maybe they just aren&rsquo;t open to new ideas.&nbsp;Think of an upcoming election where&nbsp;<I>you</I>&nbsp;nominate
two candidates and the 8 Board members nominate themselves.&nbsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like options? Real proxy access creates a
more competitive environment for directors. That increases the value of your shares. Vote FOR Proposal No. 4,&nbsp;Shareholder
Proxy Access Amendments.</P>
