<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><I>Investing in the notes involves risks. Before making a decision to invest in the notes, you should carefully consider the risks
described in Part II, Item&nbsp;1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July&nbsp;1, 2017 under the heading &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; which are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
prospectus, as well as the risks set forth below. See &#147;Where You Can Find More Information&#148; in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The notes are our obligations exclusively and not of any of our subsidiaries. A significant portion of our operations is conducted
through our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. Except to the extent we are
a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries over our
claims (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the notes). Consequently, the notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the
future acquire or establish. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The notes are subject to prior claims of any secured creditors, and if a default occurs, we may not have sufficient funds to fulfill
our obligations under the notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The notes are our unsecured general obligations, ranking equally with other unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness. As of July&nbsp;1, 2017, we had $96.6 billion of unsecured senior notes and $12.0 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes outstanding but no secured senior debt outstanding. The indenture governing the notes
permits us to incur additional debt, including secured debt. If we incur any secured debt, our assets will be subject to prior claims by our secured creditors. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, assets
that secure debt will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all debt secured by those assets has been repaid in full. Holders of the notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with all of our unsecured and
unsubordinated creditors, including our trade creditors. If we incur any additional obligations that rank equally with the notes, including trade payables, the holders of those obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the
notes and the previously issued notes in any proceeds distributed upon our insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. If there are not sufficient
assets remaining to pay all these creditors, all or a portion of the notes then outstanding would remain unpaid. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">The indenture governing the notes does not contain
financial covenants and only provides limited protection against significant corporate events and other actions we may take that could adversely impact your investment in the notes. </P>

certain events involving significant corporate transactions, such terms are limited and may not be sufficient to protect your investment in the notes. </P>

the notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not CAD entails significant risks. These risks include the possibility of significant changes in rates of exchange between the holder&#146;s home currency and CAD and the possibility of the imposition
or subsequent modification of foreign exchange controls. These risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies. In the past,
rates of exchange between CAD and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that volatility may occur in the future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not
necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may occur during the term of the notes. Depreciation of CAD against the holder&#146;s home currency would result in a decrease in the effective yield of the notes below its coupon rate and, in
certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the holder. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><I>The following description is a summary of the terms of the&nbsp;2.513% Notes due 2024 (the &#147;notes&#148;) being offered. The
descriptions in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus contain descriptions of certain terms of the notes and the indenture dated as of April&nbsp;29, 2013 (the &#147;indenture&#148;), between us and The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, under which we will issue the notes, but do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the indenture that has been filed as Exhibit
4.1 to the Company&#146;s registration statement on Form S-3 filed on April&nbsp;29, 2013 (Registration Number 333-188191), including the definitions of specified terms used in the indenture, and to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
Wherever particular articles, sections or defined terms of the indenture are referred to, it is intended that those articles, sections or defined terms will be incorporated herein by reference, and the statement in connection with which reference is
made is qualified in its entirety by the article, section or defined term in the indenture. This summary supplements the description of the debt securities in the accompanying prospectus and, to the extent it is inconsistent, replaces the
description in the accompanying prospectus. We urge you to read the indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of the notes. For purposes of this description, references to the &#147;Company,&#148;
&#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;us&#148; refer only to Apple Inc. and not to its subsidiaries. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">General </P>

registered form in minimum denominations of C$2,000 and integral multiples of C$1,000 in excess thereof. The accompanying prospectus describes additional provisions of the notes and of the indenture. There is no limit on the aggregate principal
amount of notes that we may issue under the indenture. We reserve the right, from time to time and without the consent of any holders of the notes, to re-open each series of notes on terms identical in all respects to the outstanding notes of such
series (except for the date of issuance, the date interest begins to accrue and, in certain circumstances, the first interest payment date), so that such additional notes will be consolidated with, form a single series with and increase the
aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series; provided that the additional notes will have a separate CUSIP and ISIN number unless the additional notes are fungible with the outstanding notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such
additional notes will have the same terms as to ranking, redemption, waivers, amendments or otherwise, as the applicable series of notes, and will vote together as one class on all matters with respect to such series of notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in arrears in equal installments on the

record date is a business day). If a payment date falls on a day that is not a business day (as defined below), the payment date shall be postponed to the next business day. The first interest payment will be a long first coupon payable on
February&nbsp;19, 2018 and will be in the amount of C$31,584,623.29, such payment being the equivalent of C$12.633849316 per C$1,000 of principal amount outstanding. For a full semi-annual interest period, interest on the notes will be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. For an interest period that is not a full semi-annual interest period, interest on the notes will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days in such
interest period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Ranking </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The notes will be our

controls or other circumstances beyond our control, then all payments in respect of the notes will be made in U.S. dollars until CAD is again available to us. The amount payable on any date in CAD will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate
mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most
recent U.S. dollar/CAD exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment in respect of the notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default

CDS participants include banks, investment dealers and trust companies and may include certain of the underwriters. Indirect access to CDS is available to other organizations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a CDS
participant. Transfers of ownership and other interests in notes in CDS, including cash distributions, may only be processed through CDS participants and will be completed in accordance with existing CDS rules and procedures. CDS is headquartered in
Toronto and has offices in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. CDS is a subsidiary of The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited, part of TMX Group Limited. It is affiliated with CDS Inc., which provides services to the Canadian Securities

interest income paid on notes, and the gross proceeds from a disposition of notes occurring after December&nbsp;31, 2018, in each case paid to (i)&nbsp;a &#147;foreign financial institution&#148; (as specifically defined in the Code), whether such
foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify, report and disclose its &#147;United States account&#148; holders (as specifically defined in the Code) and meets
certain other specified requirements or (ii)&nbsp;a &#147;non-financial foreign entity&#148; (as specifically defined in the Code), whether such non-financial foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary, unless such non-financial
foreign entity provides a certification that the beneficial owner of the payment does not have any substantial U.S. owners or provides the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner and certain other specified
requirements are met. In certain cases, the relevant foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity may qualify for an exemption from, or be deemed to be in compliance with, these rules. Further, foreign financial institutions located
in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. If an interest payment is subject both to withholding under FATCA and to the U.S. federal withholding tax discussed
above under &#147;&#151;Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders&#151;Payments of Interest,&#148; the U.S. federal withholding under FATCA may be credited against, and therefore reduce, such other U.S. federal withholding tax. Holders should consult their own
tax advisors regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant to their ownership and disposition of notes. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Investors may hold their interests in a global security directly through DTC if they are
DTC participants, or indirectly through organizations that are DTC participants. Except in the limited circumstances described below, holders of debt securities represented by interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive their debt
securities in fully registered certificated form. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized
under New York Banking Law, a &#147;banking organization&#148; within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a &#147;clearing corporation&#148; within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and
a &#147;clearing agency&#148; registered pursuant to the provisions of Section&nbsp;17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC (&#147;participants&#148;) and to facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC&#146;s
participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC&#146;s book-entry system is also available to others such as both U.S. and
non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, whether directly or indirectly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL"><I>Ownership of Beneficial Interests </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Upon the
issuance of each global security, DTC will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of participants.
Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be shown on, and the transfer of those
ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants&#146; interests) and such participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global security other than participants).
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be,
will be considered the sole legal owner of the debt security represented by the global security for all purposes under the indenture, the debt securities and applicable law. Except as set forth below, owners of beneficial interests in a global
security will not be entitled to receive certificated debt securities and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any debt securities represented by the global security. We understand that under existing industry practice, in the event
an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC, as the holder of the global security, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the participants to take such action, and that participants would authorize
beneficial owners owning through such participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a global security will be able to transfer such
interest except in accordance with DTC&#146;s applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of others, the ability of a person having a
beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest, may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificate representing that
interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">All payments on the debt securities represented by a global security registered in the name of and held by DTC or its

to owners of beneficial interests in the global security held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is now the case with securities held for accounts for customers registered in the names of
nominees for such customers. These payments, however, will be the responsibility of such participants and indirect participants, and neither we, the trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records
relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in any global security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship

participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. However, if there is an event of default under the debt securities, DTC will exchange each global security for certificated debt securities, which it will distribute to its participants. </P>

Clearstream will hold interests, in each case, on behalf of their participants through customers&#146; securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold such
interests in customers&#146; securities in the depositaries&#146; names on DTC&#146;s books. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Payments, deliveries, transfers,
exchanges, notices and other matters relating to the debt securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream must comply with the rules and procedures of those systems. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We have no
control over those systems or their participants, and we take no responsibility for their activities. Transactions between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, on one hand, and other participants in DTC, on the other hand, would also be subject
to DTC&#146;s rules and procedures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Investors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments,

other institutions are open for business in the United States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who

transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In addition, investors who
hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchase or sales of their interests between the U.S. and European clearing systems, and those transactions may settle later than
transactions within one clearing system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:ARIAL">Governing Law </P>
