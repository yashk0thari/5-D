PLEASE RETAIN FOR YOUR RECORDS HHSTDS HHSTS4 IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING HOUSEHOLDING ELECTION OF SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS In December 2000, the Securities Exchange Commission enacted a rule that allows multiple shareholders residing at the same
address the convenience of receiving a single copy of all shareholder communications if they consent to do so. This is known as "Householding". Please note that if you do not respond to this notice, Householding will start 60 days after the mailing
of this notification. We will allow Householding only upon these certain conditions: The issuer agrees to have its documents Househeld. You agree to or do not object to the Householding of your materials. You have the same last name and exact
address as another shareholder(s). The HOUSEHOLDING ELECTION, which appears on the enclosed proxy card, provides a means for you to notify us whether or not you consent to participate in Householding. By marking "Yes" in the block provided, you will
consent to participate in Householding. By marking "No", you will withhold your consent to participate. If you do nothing, you will be deemed to have given your consent to participate. Your affirmative or implied consent to Household will remain in
effect until you revoke it. If you wish to revoke your consent, please call 1-866-540-7095 and follow the instructions or you may send a written request with your name, the name of your financial institution and your account number at the firm to:
Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you revoke your Householding election, each primary account holder will begin receiving individual copies within 30 days of your revocation. P79122-01S V2.0 </FONT></P>
