<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Dear Ms. Peterson:</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>We write <I>again</I> to request that you immediately seek the resignation of Reid Hoffman from his directorship on the Board of Microsoft Corporation (&#8220;Microsoft&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), and that he be removed from consideration as a director candidate for reappointment at the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting. Should Mr. Hoffman refuse to voluntarily leave his position, we request that you call a special meeting of the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) to remove him.</P>

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>National Legal and Policy Center (&#8220;NLPC&#8221;) promotes ethics in public life, sponsors the Corporate Integrity Project, and is a shareholder in Microsoft. We sponsored a proposal at the Company&#8217;s 2023 annual meeting, and have submitted another one for its 2024 meeting.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>We are disturbed by Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s reported recent comments &#8211;&nbsp;which he has not denied making &#8211; about former President Donald Trump, which were reported roughly a day before an assassination attempt against the former president at his campaign rally in Butler, Pa. Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s comments appeared to condone political violence against the frontrunner in the 2024 presidential election.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>The comments were reportedly made at Allen &amp; Company&#8217;s Sun Valley Conference 2024. According to Puck News:<SUP><A name=_ftnb1 /><A href=#_ftnf1><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0;margin-left:18pt'>Peter Thiel sarcastically thanked Reid Hoffman for funding lawsuits against Trump because they had turned him into &#8220;a martyr,&#8221; increasing his chances of re-election.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0;margin-left:18pt'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0;margin-left:18pt'>From the stage, Hoffman shot back with his own sarcastic quip: &#8220;Yeah, I wish I had made him an actual martyr.&#8221;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>The assassination attempt resulted in the death of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter attending the rally with his family,<SUP><A name=_ftnb2 /><A href=#_ftnf2><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP> and led to injuries to President Trump and others.</P>

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>We previously sent the Board a letter (copy attached) on October 6, 2023, which called for Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s resignation or removal. Among our concerns at the time &#8211;&nbsp;which still remain &#8211; was Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s extensive relationship with the late pedophile and investor Jeffrey Epstein. The former notoriously provided the latter with introductions and connections to powerful figures in Silicon Valley. Further, Mr. Hoffman visited Mr. Epstein&#8217;s New York and Little St. James residencies, where Mr. Epstein was known to catalog child pornography and facilitate sexual relationships with minors for his friends and clients.<SUP><A name=_ftnb3 /><A href=#_ftnf3><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>We were also concerned with Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s outlandish, intemperate political activities and his controversial public persona. As we detailed in our letter, Mr. Hoffman has always criticized President Trump and supported liberal causes. But he appears to have a weak self-governing mechanism, as his political activities have occasionally gotten him in hot water.<SUP><A name=_ftnb4 /><A href=#_ftnf4><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP> NLPC warned that his increasingly inflammatory and abrasive tone, and his excesses, would only become more of a liability for Microsoft.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>And in our October 2023 letter, we concluded by questioning the Board (in the context of Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s ties to Mr. Epstein), &#8220;What&#8217;s next to be revealed? Is the Company willing to wait and find out the next shoe that drops to see how embarrassing it is?&#8221;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>The Company ignored our warnings, and now here we are following the assassination attempt of President Trump, only days after Mr. Hoffman &#8211;&nbsp;among a sizable crowd of his fellow billionaires &#8211;&nbsp;openly wished him dead. This is among the worst of the kind of rhetoric that has been blamed for the vehement and often dangerous political divisions in the United States. Mr. Hoffman clearly thinks it&#8217;s a big joke.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Microsoft cannot ignore Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s outrageous behavior any longer. In his response to the attempted assassination on Mr. Trump, Mr. Hoffman did not deny the comments he made to Mr. Thiel. Instead, he repeated debunked claims about Mr. Trump,<SUP><A name=_ftnb5 /><A href=#_ftnf5><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP> blamed him for the tense political climate in the United States, and doubled down on the incendiary rhetoric that contributed to such a climate in the first place. Further, Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s top political advisor, Dmitri Mehlhorn, urged reporters to consider that the assassination attack was &#8220;staged,&#8221; before issuing an apology following vehement blowback to his efforts.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>NLPC accepts Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s right to make political statements and donations, but his implicit calls for violence are beyond the pale, as well as his previous conduct that we called attention to last October. He shows no remorse. He must resign from Microsoft&#8217;s board of directors or be </P>

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>In recent months and years it has come to light that Mr. Hoffman &#8211;&nbsp;in various capacities as a corporate leader, investor, fundraiser, political activist, philanthropist, and private citizen &#8211;&nbsp;has conducted himself in a manner that calls into question his judgment, character, and transparency, bringing reputational and material harm to Microsoft.</P>

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Mr. Hoffman pursued and sustained relationships, and maintained professional partnerships to benefit mutual interests, with the late convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, long after his disreputable character was established.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Mr. Epstein was sentenced in Florida in June 2008 to eighteen months in prison, and was required to register as a sex offender in jurisdictions he frequented.<SUP><A name=_ftnb6 /><A href=#_ftnf6><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP> Both during and after release from serving (what most observers considered) an extremely lenient penalty, he continued his jet-setting lifestyle, which included ongoing personal and professional relationships with well-known, wealthy public figures, including Mr. Hoffman. According to several reports based upon lawsuits and publicly released information, Mr. Epstein&#8217;s efforts served a dual purpose: to lure these powerful figures into his sex abuse activities for potential blackmailing &#8211;&nbsp;many which took place on his private island, Little St. James, in the Virgin Islands &#8211;&nbsp;and/or to persuade investors and donors to fund his financial and charitable interests.</P>

Perhaps most notably, Epstein appeared to serve as an intermediary between the lab and other wealthy donors, soliciting millions of dollars in donations from individuals and organizations, including the technologist and philanthropist Bill Gates and the investor Leon Black&#8230;The effort to conceal the lab&#8217;s contact with Epstein was so widely known that some staff in the office of the lab&#8217;s director, Joi Ito, referred to Epstein as Voldemort or &#8220;he who must not be named.&#8221;</P>

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Mr. Hoffman has published his political opinions in different forums, including his own page on LinkedIn. For a man of his wealth, experience and intellect, however, he demonstrates a surprising lack of logical consistency in his views.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>As one example, in April 2021 he published a commentary about &#8220;protecting voting rights,&#8221;<SUP><A name=_ftnb29 /><A href=#_ftnf29><SUP>29</SUP></A></SUP> which largely addressed the notorious election integrity law in Georgia that was passed, but was demonized by the political left (including President Biden) as &#8220;voter suppression&#8221; and &#8220;Jim Crow 2.0.&#8221; Among his arguments, Mr. Hoffman complained that such laws as the Peach State&#8217;s &#8220;[reduced] drop boxes and mobile polling places; [imposed] new bureaucratic burdens on absentee voters; and even makes it a crime for people who aren&#8217;t poll workers to provide &#8216;food and drink&#8217; to voters within 150 feet of a polling place.&#8221; Omitted from Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s grievances were facts about past abuses of such practices: unmonitored drop boxes where individuals stuffed multiple ballots; lack of voter ID and other measures to confirm identities of absentee voters; and the corruptibility of &#8220;buying&#8221; votes by giving away items of value.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>These points, of course, are all worthy of debate and a Microsoft director need not be expected to toe one side or the other. But a reasoned, experienced businessman should at least express an understanding that there are rational alternate perspectives. But rather than recognize that, Mr. Hoffman chooses to demonize opponents on the issue. In doing so he presented a business analogy to voting access:</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0;margin-left:14.4pt'>As business leaders, we strive to make the products and services our companies create as useful and accessible as we can. We want our customers to use them. We want to broaden our customer bases. Similarly, in a democracy like ours, we should strive to create&#160;more civic participation and an increasingly engaged electorate.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Mr. Hoffman might be more believable if he was equally critical of the social media product he co-founded: LinkedIn.

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Simple Internet searches reveal countless other examples of historical LinkedIn censorship, many of which include frustrating experiences by users who cannot get straight answers about the removal of their content, or about denial of access to their accounts.<SUP><A name=_ftnb33 /><A href=#_ftnf33><SUP>33</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Mr. Hoffman, a director of LinkedIn parent Microsoft, could easily advocate for the website to remain open to all for reasoned political debate, but there is no evidence that he does. In fact, his own history indicates that he encourages such snubs. As a self-styled expert on venture capital-funded startups, upon which his co-authored advice book <I>Blitzscaling</I> has been turned into a Stanford University course, Mr. Hoffman recommends one counterintuitive business practice for an alleged path to success: &#8220;Ignore your customers.&#8221;<SUP><A name=_ftnb34 /><A href=#_ftnf34><SUP>34</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>While the National Legal and Policy Center respects Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s right to make political donations, as Microsoft shareholders, we believe his partisan political activities damage the firm&#8217;s reputation. In addition, Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s political activism, and affiliation with controversial and unethical organizations, risk alienating a significant portion of the firm&#8217;s customer base, which could be offended by Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s political activities. He often adopts a caustic and vindictive approach which is unbecoming of a signature representative of the Company, not to mention as the iconic co-founder of one of its top products. Respectfulness and tone matter.</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P style='font:12pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>Even worse, Mr. Hoffman&#8217;s connections with Mr. Epstein present a significant liability to Microsoft&#8217;s brand. Despite his attempts to distance himself from the renowned convicted pedophile, investigative reports continue to implicate Mr. Hoffman in the furtherance of Mr. Epstein&#8217;s social capital. What&#8217;s next to be revealed? Is the Company willing to wait and find out the next shoe that drops to see how embarrassing it is?</P>
