enacted a rule that allows multiple shareholders residing at the same address the convenience of receiving a single copy of all shareholder communications if they consent to do so. This is known as &#147;Householding&#148;. Please note that if you
do not respond to this notice, Householding will start 60 days after the mailing of this notification. We will allow Householding only upon these certain conditions: The issuer agrees to have its documents Househeld. You agree to or do not object to
the Householding of your materials. You have the same last name and exact address as another shareholder(s). The HOUSEHOLDING ELECTION, which appears on the enclosed proxy card, provides a means for you to notify us whether or not you consent to
participate in Householding. By marking &#147;Yes&#148; in the block provided, you will consent to participate in Householding. By marking &#147;No&#148;, you will withhold your consent to participate. If you do nothing, you will be deemed to have
given your consent to participate. Your affirmative or implied consent to Household will remain in effect until you revoke it. If you wish to revoke your consent, please call 1-866-540-7095 and follow the instructions or you may send a written
request with your name, the name of your financial institution and your account number at the firm to: Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you revoke your Householding election, each primary account holder will begin
receiving individual copies within 30 days of your revocation. </FONT></P>
