<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Dear Microsoft Corporation Shareholders,</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are writing to urge you to <B>VOTE &ldquo;FOR&rdquo; PROPOSAL 2
</B>on the proxy card, which asks the Company to report on the company&rsquo;s workplace sexual harassment policies and investigations.
The Proposal makes the following request:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><B>RESOLVED: </B></FONT>Shareholders
urge the Board of Directors to release a transparency report (at reasonable expense, omitting confidential or privileged
information) to shareholders assessing the effectiveness of the company's workplace sexual harassment policies, including the
results of any comprehensive, independent audit/investigations, analysis of policies and practices, and commitments to create a
safe, inclusive work environment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>SUPPORTING STATEMENT:</B> Proponents suggest the report be published
annually and summarize:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">- Effectiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies,
trainings, and measures;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">- Results of any independent investigation into executive level allegations,
including recent Gates&rsquo; allegations;<BR>
- Steps taken (or that could be taken) to hold employees and executives accountable;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">- Number of sexual harassment cases investigated and the resolution.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">While we acknowledge Microsoft&rsquo;s most recent commitment in response
to our proposal, which is published in its opposition statement, it does not alleviate the scope of our concerns. The company&rsquo;s
pledge to begin annual public reporting on sexual harassment and gender discrimination allegations ignores the need for reporting on independent
and executive-level investigations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Investors are concerned about current and past accusations of sexual
harassment at Microsoft and how such accusations can impact shareholder value. In recent years, numerous companies have incurred substantial
reputational and investment costs because of sexual harassment allegations. The #MeToo era has highlighted companies&rsquo; systemic tolerance
of sexual harassment and a tendency to protect assailants, especially those in leadership positions. After Wynn Resorts&rsquo; CEO Steve
Wynn was accused of sexual misconduct, the company saw a $3 billion drop in market value. In 2017, Uber&rsquo;s market value tumbled after
reports of leadership&rsquo;s complicity in addressing workplace sexual harassment. In 2018, the Board of 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century Fox
agreed to a $90 million settlement after leadership failed to adequately address sexual harassment claims.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Companies that struggle with systemic workplace sexual harassment also
experience lower employee morale, lower employee productivity, and higher employee turnover. Due to this significant business risk, Microsoft
must transparently and effectively address its sexual harassment claims.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Microsoft&rsquo;s most recent promise to better resource and publish
the results of internal investigations follows a list of previously unfulfilled commitments to improve internal HR processes related to
sexual harassment. Given its history, Microsoft appears to only adequately respond to sexual harassment and gender discrimination allegations
when confronted with external, public accountability.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Unfulfilled Commitments:</B> From 2010-2016, female employees at
Microsoft filed 238 sexual harassment complaints. Upon internal investigation, Microsoft only deemed one as founded. After the court documents
were unsealed in 2018, Microsoft released a statement committing to adequately manage sexual harassment investigations in the future.
In 2019, Microsoft once again faced public pressure after a company-wide email chain circulated detailing women&rsquo;s sexual harassment
experiences at the company and HR&rsquo;s disappointing responses. CEO Satya Nadella responded to these allegations with <B>another</B>
commitment to reform HR processes and publish internal investigation data moving forward. Although Microsoft states they began internal
reporting in February 2020, several employees had yet to see promised reports or an improved corporate culture as of June 2020.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Executive-level Accusations:</B> There are also concerns of Microsoft&rsquo;s
mismanagement of executive-level sexual harassment investigations. While many top executives were reportedly aware of accusations of Mr.
Gates&rsquo; former inappropriate employee relations, the Board of Directors only opened an investigation after this news became public
in 2019. Mr. Gates willingly resigned from the Board in early 2020, quelling public pressure. To our knowledge, the investigation has
not yet been completed.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This history puts in question Microsoft&rsquo;s ability to conduct
effective and transparent internal investigations, as employees claim that Microsoft has previously disregarded harassment claims and
only moved towards action when held accountable in a public forum. Therefore, we do not believe that the current commitment, published
in the opposition statement, will adequately resolve Microsoft&rsquo;s perceived culture of systemic sexual harassment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%" STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt"><TR STYLE="vertical-align: top">
<TD STYLE="width: 0.25in"></TD><TD STYLE="width: 0.25in"><B>3.</B></TD><TD><B>Microsoft has not committed to best practice independent investigations of sexual harassment cases, at the employee or executive
level. </B></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We believe that independent investigations into sexual harassment allegations
are critical, especially at the executive level, due to the quantity of sexual harassment claims filed at Microsoft, allegations of serious
misconduct by Mr. Gates, the company&rsquo;s current exposure to adverse publicity, and the company&rsquo;s historical missteps with internal
investigations. The Council of Institutional Investors states that best practice sexual harassment investigation should involve &ldquo;non-conflicted
outside law firms&hellip;particularly involving allegations against the CEO and other top officers.&rdquo; With corporate power structures
at play, internal investigations are subject to internal biases that prevent the company from adequately evaluating and resolving harassment
claims. An external investigation is the primary way to objectively hold those culpable accountable and alleviate shareholders&rsquo;
concerns.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The shareholder resolution explicitly requests that Microsoft report
on the &ldquo;results of any independent investigation into executive level allegations, including recent Gates&rsquo; allegations.&rdquo;
Microsoft&rsquo;s opposition statement is completely silent on this request. It is executive leadership&rsquo;s responsibility to model
ethical corporate behavior and ensure accountability for wrongdoings. As former founder, CEO, and Board Director, Mr. Gates&rsquo; allegations
have caused concerns about a potential top-down culture of sexual harassment. This creates significant risks for investors if not properly
resolved.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">For Microsoft to effectively eradicate any culture of systemic sexual
harassment, we believe it must allow for an independent investigation into these allegations and publicly disclose the results. This investigation
will send a clear message to investors and employees that the company will not tolerate sexual harassment, no matter the employee&rsquo;s
level of seniority.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">For all the reasons provided above, we strongly urge you to support
the Proposal. We believe a report on an independent investigation into Microsoft&rsquo;s sexual harassment claims, especially at the executive
level, will help ensure a transparent, safe, and inclusive corporate culture that is in the long-term best interest of shareholders.</P>
